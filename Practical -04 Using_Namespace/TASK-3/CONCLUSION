we are using neither scope resolution operator(SRO) nor the using namespace keyword so the compiler will fail to compile and will give the error of undeclared identifier as the scope of the identifier will not be defined and hence it will pass the preprocessor phase of the compiler but  will not be able to pass the compilation phase of the compiler and therefore it will generate an error.
